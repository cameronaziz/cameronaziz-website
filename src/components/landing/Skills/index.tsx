          <h2>More about me</h2>
          <p>
            My passion for open source technologies has allowed me to take products and applications from conception to
            production. I am a trusted communicator between technical and non-technical staff which allows me to architect
            solutions that are both rapid to deploy and easily scalable
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a full stack engineer specializing in Node.
            I have worked on devops, backend and frontend teams individually and I enjoy web technologies such as React, GraphQL and library development.
          </p>
